# This is a todo app

## Details
It utilizes a React/Redux front end, with the redux toolkit for managing actions and reducers.

The backend is a rails api, serving json objects using jbuilder

## Setup details

* Clone the repo

* yarn install (this project used yarn rather than npm)

* bundle install (both the rails api as well as the react portion can be built from the top level)

* Bundle exec rails db:setup (creates and populates the database with some seed data, check "seeds.rb" for login info, or create a user)
